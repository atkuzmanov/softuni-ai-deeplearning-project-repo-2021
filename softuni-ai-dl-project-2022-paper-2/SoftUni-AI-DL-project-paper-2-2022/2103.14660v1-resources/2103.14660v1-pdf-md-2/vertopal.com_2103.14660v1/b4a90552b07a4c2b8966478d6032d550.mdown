**ABSTRACT**

Preventable or undiagnosed visual impairment and blindness affect
billion of people worldwide. Automated multi-disease detection models
offer great potential to address this problem via clinical decision
support in diagnosis. In this work, we proposed an innovative
multi-disease detection pipeline for retinal imaging which utilizes
ensemble learning to combine the predictive capabilities of several
heterogeneous deep convolutional neural network models. Our pipeline
includes state-of-the-art strategies like transfer learning, class
weighting, real-time image augmentation and Focal loss utilization.
Furthermore, we integrated ensemble learning techniques like
heterogeneous deep learning models, bagging via 5-fold cross-validation
and stacked logistic regression models. Through internal and external
evaluation, we were able to validate and demonstrate high accuracy and
reliability of our pipeline, as well as the comparability with other
stateof-the-art pipelines for retinal disease prediction.

**1. INTRODUCTION**

Even if the medical progress in the last 30 years made it possible to
successfully treat the majority of diseases causing visual impairment,
growing and aging populations lead to an increasing challenge in retinal
disease diagnosis \[1\]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
the prevalence of blindness and visual impairment to 2.2 billion people
worldwide, of whom at least 1 billion affections could have been
prevented or is yet to be addressed \[2\]. Early detection and correct
diagnosis are essential to forestall disease course and prevent
blindness.

The use of clinical decision support (CDS) systems for diagnosis has
been increasing over the past decade \[3\]. Recently, modern deep
learning models allow automated and reliable classification of medical
images with remarkable accuracy comparable to physicians \[4\].
Nevertheless, these models often lack capabilities to detect rare
pathologies such as central retinal artery occlusion or anterior
ischemic optic neuropathy \[5\], \[6\].

> multi-disease detection pipeline based on ensemble, transfer and deep
> learning techniques. Furthermore, we utilize the new Retinal Fundus
> Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD) containing various rare and
> challenging conditions to demonstrate our detection capabilities for
> uncommon diseases.

**2. METHODS**

The images were annotated with 46 conditions, including various rare and
challenging diseases, through adjudicated consensus of two senior
retinal experts. These 46 conditions are represented by the following
classes, which are also listed in Tab. 1: An overall normal/abnormal
class, 27 specific condition classes and 1 'OTHER' class consisting of
the remaining extremely rare conditions. Besides the training dataset,
the organizers of the RIADD challenge hold 1280 images back for external
validation and testing datasets to ensure robust evaluation \[7\],
\[8\].

**2.2. Preprocessing and Image Augmentation**\
In order to simplify the pattern finding process of the deep learning
model, as well as to increase data variability, we applied several
preprocessing methods.

> We utilized extensive image augmentation for up-

sampling to balance class distribution and real-time augmentation during
training to obtain novel and unique images in each epoch. The
augmentation techniques consisted of rotation, flipping, and altering in
brightness, saturation, contrast and hue. Through the up-sampling, it
was ensured that each label occurred at least 100 times in the dataset
which increased the total number of training images from 1920 to 3354.

Afterwards, all images were square padded in order to avoid aspect ratio
loss during posterior resizing. The retinal images were also cropped to
ensure that the fundus is center located in the image. The cropping was
performed individually for each microscope resolution and resulted in
the following image shapes: 1424x1424, 1536x1536 and 3464x3464 pixels.
The images were then resized to model

> input sizes according to the neural network architecture, which was
> 380x380 for EfficientNetB4, 299x299 for InceptionV3 and 244x244 for
> all remaining architectures \[9\]--\[12\].
>
> Before feeding the image to the deep convolutional neural network, we
> applied value intensity normalization as last preprocessing step. The
> intensities were zero-centered via the Z-Score normalization approach
> based on the mean and standard deviation computed on the ImageNet
> dataset \[13\].
>
> **2.3. Deep Learning Models**\
> The state-of-the-art for medical image classification are the
> unmatched deep convolutional neural network models \[4\], \[14\].
> Nevertheless, the hyper parameter configuration and architecture
> selection are highly dependent on the required computer vision task,
> as well as the key difference between pipelines \[4\], \[15\]. Thus,

after 8 epochs without improvement on the monitored validation loss)
\[16\]. Furthermore, an early stopping and model checkpoint technique
was utilized for the fine-tuning process, stopping after 20 epochs
without improvement (after epoch 60) and saving the best model measured
according to the validation loss. Instead of defining an epoch as a
cycle through the full training dataset, we establish an epoch to have
250 iterations. This allowed to increase the number of seen batches and,
thus, to increase the information given to the model during the fitting
process of an epoch. As training loss function, we utilized the weighted
Focal loss from *Lin et al.* \[17\].

> FL(𝑝𝑡) = −𝛼𝑡(1 − 𝑝𝑡)𝛾 log (𝑝𝑡) (1)

In the above formula, *pt* is the probability for the correct ground
truth class *t*, *γ* a tunable focusing parameter (which we set to 2.0)
and *αt* the associated weight for class *t*.

*2.3.1 Disease Risk Detector*\
The disease risk detector was established as a binary classifier of the
disease risk class for general categorizing between normal and abnormal
retinal images. Thus, this model type was trained using only the disease
risk class and ignoring all multi-label annotations. Rather than using a
single model architecture, we trained multiple models based on the
DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB4 architecture \[9\], \[10\]. For class
weight computation, we divided the number of samples by the
multiplication of the number of classes (2 for a binary classification)
with the number of class occurrences in the dataset.

*2.3.2 Disease Label Classifier*\
In contrast, the disease label classifier was established as multi-label
classifier of all 28 remaining classes (excluding disease risk) and was
trained on the one hot encoded array of the disease labels. Furthermore,
we utilized four different architectures for this model type: ResNet152,
InceptionV3, DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB4 \[9\]--\[12\]. Identical to
class weight computation of the disease risk detector, we computed the
weights individually as binary classification for each class. Even if
this classifier is provided with all classes, the binary weights balance
the decision for each label individually.

**2.4. Ensemble Learning Strategy**\
*2.4.1 Bagging*\
Next to the utilization of multiple architecture, we also applied a
5-fold cross-validation based as a bagging approach for ensemble
learning. Our aim was to create a large variety of models which were
trained on different subsets of the training data. This approach not
only allowed a more efficient usage of the available training data, but
also increased the

> reliability of a prediction. This strategy resulted in an ensemble of
> 10 disease risk detector models (2 architectures with each 5 folds)
> and 20 disease label classifier models (4 architectures with each 5
> folds).
>
> *2.4.2 Stacking*\
> For combining the predictions of our, in total, 30 models, we
> integrated a stacking setup. On top of all deep convolutional neural
> networks, we applied a binary logistic regression algorithm for each
> class, individually. Thus, the predictions of all models were utilized

> disease risk and 28 for each disease-label including the 'other'
> class). The individual predicted class probabilities are then
> concatenated to the final prediction.

validation loss, it was still possible to obtain a powerful model for
detection.

**3.1. Internal Performance Evaluation**\
For estimating the performance of our pipeline, we utilized the
validation subsets of the 5-fold cross-validation models from the
heavily augmented version of our dataset. This approach allowed to
obtain testing samples which were never seen in the training process for
reliable performance evaluation. For the complex multi-label evaluation,
we computed the popular area under the receiver operating characteristic
(AUROC) curve, as well as the mean average precision (mAP). Both scores
were macro-averaged over classes and cross-validation folds to reduce
complexity.

Our multi-disease detection pipeline revealed a strong and robust
classification performance with the capability to also detect rare
conditions accurately in retinal images. Whereas the disease label
classifier models separately only achieved an AUROC of around 0.97 and a
mAP of 0.93, the disease risk detectors demonstrated to have a really
strong predictive power of 0.98 up to 0.99 AUROC and mAP. However, for
the classifiers the InceptionV3 architecture indicated to have the worst
performance compared to the other architectures with only 0.93 AUROC and
0.66 mAP. The associated receiver operating characteristics of the
models are illustrated in Fig. 3.

Training a strong multi-label classifier is in general a complex task,
however, the extreme class imbalance between the conditions revealed a
hard challenge for building a reliable model \[19\], \[20\]. Our applied
up-sampling and class weighting technique demonstrated to have a
critical boost on the predictive capabilities of the classifier models.

evaluation of the predictive power of our pipeline on an unseen and
unpublished testing set, but also the comparison with the currently best
retinal disease classifiers in the world.

In our participation, we were able to reach rank 19 from a total of 59
teams in the first evaluation phase and rank 8 in the final phase. In
the independent evaluation from the challenge organizers, we achieved an
AUROC of 0.95 for the disease risk classification. For multi-label
scoring, they computed the average between the macro-averaged AUROC and
the mAP, for which we reached the score 0.70. The top performing ranks
shared only a marginal scoring difference which is why we had only a
final score difference of 0.05 to the first ranked team. Furthermore,
the participation results demonstrated that ensemble learning based
classification for deep convolutional neural network models is
compatible or even superior to other approaches in the scientific field
such as focusing on a single large architecture.

**3.3. Experiments and Improvements**\
Additionally, we experimented with using weighted crossentropy loss for
training our both model types. This resulted in inferior models for
disease label classification, however, the cross-entropy loss fitted
disease risk detector models showed less overfitting with equal
performance. Further experimentation with loss functions for the disease
risk detector models could provide the solution to avoid overfitting.

> An important point for the RIADD challenge

participation would be the utilization of more training data, especially
for the difficult 'CRS' and 'EDN' classes. According to the challenge
rules, other public available datasets like Kaggle DR, IDRiD, Messidor
or APTOS are allowed to be used as additional training data \[8\]. Our
pipeline, which was trained exclusively on the RFMiD dataset, could be
further improved with more retinal images of very rare conditions.
Besides the training data, more improvement points for further research
in retinal disease detection would be the inclusion of image cropping
strategies to reduce information loss through resolution resizing, the
usage of more architectures (especially with different input
resolutions) to increase the model ensemble, and the utilization of
specific retinal filters or retinal vessel segmentation as additional
information to utilize for the predictions.

**4. CONCLUSIONS**

In this study, we introduced a powerful multi-disease detection pipeline
for retinal imaging which exploits ensemble learning techniques to
combine the predictions of various deep convolutional neural network
models. Next to state-of-the-art strategies, such as transfer learning,
class weighting, extensive real-time image augmentation and Focal loss
utilization, we applied 5-fold cross-validation as bagging technique and
used multiple convolutional neural network
