### ABSTRACT

Preventable or undiagnosed visual impairment and blindness
affect billion of people worldwide. Automated multi-disease
detection models offer great potential to address this problem
via clinical decision support in diagnosis. In this work, we
proposed an innovative multi-disease detection pipeline for
retinal imaging which utilizes ensemble learning to combine
the predictive capabilities of several heterogeneous deep
convolutional neural network models. Our pipeline includes
state-of-the-art strategies like transfer learning, class
weighting, real-time image augmentation and Focal loss
utilization. Furthermore, we integrated ensemble learning
techniques like heterogeneous deep learning models, bagging
via 5-fold cross-validation and stacked logistic regression
models. Through internal and external evaluation, we were
able to validate and demonstrate high accuracy and reliability
of our pipeline, as well as the comparability with other state-
of-the-art pipelines for retinal disease prediction.

**1. INTRODUCTION**

Even if the medical progress in the last 30 years made it
possible to successfully treat the majority of diseases causing
visual impairment, growing and aging populations lead to an
increasing challenge in retinal disease diagnosis [1]. The
World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the prevalence
of blindness and visual impairment to 2.2 billion people
worldwide, of whom at least 1 billion affections could have
been prevented or is yet to be addressed [2]. Early detection
and correct diagnosis are essential to forestall disease course
and prevent blindness.
The use of clinical decision support (CDS) systems
for diagnosis has been increasing over the past decade [3].
Recently, modern deep learning models allow automated and
reliable classification of medical images with remarkable
accuracy comparable to physicians [4]. Nevertheless, these
models often lack capabilities to detect rare pathologies such
as central retinal artery occlusion or anterior ischemic optic
neuropathy [5], [6].

```
In this study we push towards creating a highly
accurate and reliable multi-disease detection pipeline based
on ensemble, transfer and deep learning techniques.
Furthermore, we utilize the new Retinal Fundus Multi-
Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD) containing various rare and
challenging conditions to demonstrate our detection
capabilities for uncommon diseases.
```
**2. METHODS**

```
The implemented medical image classification pipeline can
be summarized in the following core steps and is illustrated
in Fig. 1 :
```
- Stratified multi-label 5-fold cross-validation
- Class weighted Focal loss and up-sampling
- Extensive real-time image augmentation
- Multiple deep learning model architectures
- Ensemble learning strategies: bagging and stacking
- Individual training for multi-disease labels and disease risk
detection utilizing transfer learning on ImageNet
- Stacked binary logistic regression models for distinct
classification

```
2. 1. Retinal Imaging Dataset
```
```
The RFMiD dataset consists of 3200 retinal images for which
1920 images were used as training dataset [7]. The fundus
images were captured by three different fundus cameras
having a resolution of 4288x2848 (277 images), 2048x
(150 images) and 2144x1424 (1493 images), respectively.

```

The images were annotated with 46 conditions, including
various rare and challenging diseases, through adjudicated
consensus of two senior retinal experts. These 46 conditions
are represented by the following classes, which are also listed
in Tab. 1 : An overall normal/abnormal class, 27 specific
condition classes and 1 ‘OTHER’ class consisting of the
remaining extremely rare conditions. Besides the training
dataset, the organizers of the RIADD challenge hold 1280
images back for external validation and testing datasets to
ensure robust evaluation [7], [8].

**2. 2. Preprocessing and Image Augmentation**

In order to simplify the pattern finding process of the deep
learning model, as well as to increase data variability, we
applied several preprocessing methods.
We utilized extensive image augmentation for up-
sampling to balance class distribution and real-time
augmentation during training to obtain novel and unique
images in each epoch. The augmentation techniques
consisted of rotation, flipping, and altering in brightness,
saturation, contrast and hue. Through the up-sampling, it was
ensured that each label occurred at least 100 times in the
dataset which increased the total number of training images
from 1920 to 3354.
Afterwards, all images were square padded in order
to avoid aspect ratio loss during posterior resizing. The retinal
images were also cropped to ensure that the fundus is center
located in the image. The cropping was performed
individually for each microscope resolution and resulted in
the following image shapes: 1424x1424, 1536x1536 and
3464x3464 pixels. The images were then resized to model

```
input sizes according to the neural network architecture,
which was 380x380 for EfficientNetB4, 299x299 for
InceptionV3 and 244x244 for all remaining architectures [9]–
[12].
Before feeding the image to the deep convolutional
neural network, we applied value intensity normalization as
last preprocessing step. The intensities were zero-centered via
the Z-Score normalization approach based on the mean and
standard deviation computed on the ImageNet dataset [13].
```
```
2. 3. Deep Learning Models
```
```
The state-of-the-art for medical image classification are the
unmatched deep convolutional neural network models [4],
[14]. Nevertheless, the hyper parameter configuration and
architecture selection are highly dependent on the required
computer vision task, as well as the key difference between
pipelines [4], [15]. Thus, our pipeline combines two different
types of image classification models: The disease risk
detector for binary classifying normal/abnormal images and
the disease label classifier for multi-label annotation of
abnormal images.
Both model types were pretrained on the ImageNet
dataset [13]. For the fitting process, we applied a transfer
learning training, with frozen architecture layers except for
the classification head, and a fine-tuning strategy with
unfrozen layers. Whereas the transfer learning fitting was
performed for 10 epochs using the Adam optimization with
an initial learning rate of 1-E04, the fine-tuning had a
maximal training time of 290 epochs and using a dynamic
learning rate for the Adam optimization starting from 1-E
to a maximum decrease to 1-E07 (decreasing factor of 0.

imaging. The workflow is starting with the retinal imaging dataset (RFMiD) and ends with computed predictions for novel
images.
```

after 8 epochs without improvement on the monitored
validation loss) [16]. Furthermore, an early stopping and
model checkpoint technique was utilized for the fine-tuning
process, stopping after 20 epochs without improvement (after
epoch 60) and saving the best model measured according to
the validation loss. Instead of defining an epoch as a cycle
through the full training dataset, we establish an epoch to
have 250 iterations. This allowed to increase the number of
seen batches and, thus, to increase the information given to
the model during the fitting process of an epoch. As training
loss function, we utilized the weighted Focal loss from _Lin et
al._ [17].

```
FL(𝑝𝑡)= −𝛼𝑡( 1 −𝑝𝑡)𝛾 log (𝑝𝑡) (1)
```
In the above formula, _pt_ is the probability for the correct
ground truth class _t_ , _γ_ a tunable focusing parameter (which

## we set to 2.0) and αt the associated weight for class t.

_2.3.1 Disease Risk Detector_

The disease risk detector was established as a binary classifier
of the disease risk class for general categorizing between
normal and abnormal retinal images. Thus, this model type
was trained using only the disease risk class and ignoring all
multi-label annotations. Rather than using a single model
architecture, we trained multiple models based on the
DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB4 architecture [9], [10]. For
class weight computation, we divided the number of samples
by the multiplication of the number of classes (2 for a binary
classification) with the number of class occurrences in the
dataset.

_2.3.2 Disease Label Classifier_

In contrast, the disease label classifier was established as
multi-label classifier of all 28 remaining classes (excluding
disease risk) and was trained on the one hot encoded array of
the disease labels. Furthermore, we utilized four different
architectures for this model type: ResNet152, InceptionV3,
DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB4 [9]–[12]. Identical to class
weight computation of the disease risk detector, we computed
the weights individually as binary classification for each
class. Even if this classifier is provided with all classes, the
binary weights balance the decision for each label
individually.

**2 .4. Ensemble Learning Strategy**

_2.4.1 Bagging_

Next to the utilization of multiple architecture, we also
applied a 5-fold cross-validation based as a bagging approach
for ensemble learning. Our aim was to create a large variety
of models which were trained on different subsets of the
training data. This approach not only allowed a more efficient
usage of the available training data, but also increased the

```
reliability of a prediction. This strategy resulted in an
ensemble of 10 disease risk detector models (2 architectures
with each 5 folds) and 20 disease label classifier models (
architectures with each 5 folds).
```
```
2.4.2 Stacking
```
```
For combining the predictions of our, in total, 30 models, we
integrated a stacking setup. On top of all deep convolutional
neural networks, we applied a binary logistic regression
algorithm for each class, individually. Thus, the predictions
of all models were utilized as input for computing the
classification of a single class. This approach allowed
combining the information of all other class predictions to
derive an inference for one single class. Overall, this strategy
resulted in 29 distinct logistic regression models (1 for
disease risk and 28 for each disease-label including the
‘other’ class). The individual predicted class probabilities are
then concatenated to the final prediction.
The logistic regression models were also trained
with the same 5-fold cross-validation sampling on a heavily
augmented version of the training dataset to avoid overfitting
as well as avoiding training the logistic regression models on
already seen images from the neural network models. As
logistic regression solver, we utilized the large-scale bound-
constrained optimization (short: ‘LBFGS’) from Zhu et al.
[18].
```
**3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

```
The sequential training of a complete cross-validation for one
architecture on a single NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU took
around 13.5 hours with 63 epochs on average for each deep
convolutional neural network model. Logistic Regression
training required less than 30 minutes for all class models
combined. No signs of overfitting were observed for the
disease label classifiers through validation monitoring, as it
can be seen in Fig. 2. However, the disease risk detectors
showed a strong trend to overfit after the transfer learning
phase. Through our strategy to use the model with the best

and validation data. The lines were computed via locally

loss across all folds. The gray areas around the lines

```

validation loss, it was still possible to obtain a powerful
model for detection.

**3.1. Internal Performance Evaluation**

For estimating the performance of our pipeline, we utilized
the validation subsets of the 5-fold cross-validation models
from the heavily augmented version of our dataset. This
approach allowed to obtain testing samples which were never
seen in the training process for reliable performance
evaluation. For the complex multi-label evaluation, we
computed the popular area under the receiver operating
characteristic (AUROC) curve, as well as the mean average
precision (mAP). Both scores were macro-averaged over
classes and cross-validation folds to reduce complexity.
Our multi-disease detection pipeline revealed a
strong and robust classification performance with the
capability to also detect rare conditions accurately in retinal
images. Whereas the disease label classifier models
separately only achieved an AUROC of around 0.97 and a
mAP of 0.93, the disease risk detectors demonstrated to have
a really strong predictive power of 0.98 up to 0.99 AUROC
and mAP. However, for the classifiers the InceptionV
architecture indicated to have the worst performance
compared to the other architectures with only 0.93 AUROC
and 0.66 mAP. The associated receiver operating
characteristics of the models are illustrated in Fig. 3.
Training a strong multi-label classifier is in general
a complex task, however, the extreme class imbalance
between the conditions revealed a hard challenge for building
a reliable model [19], [20]. Our applied up-sampling and
class weighting technique demonstrated to have a critical
boost on the predictive capabilities of the classifier models.
Nearly all labels were able to be accurately detected,

```
including the ‘OTHER’ class consisting of various extremely
rare conditions. Nevertheless, the two classes ‘EDN’ and
‘CRS’ were the most challenging conditions for all classifier
models. Both classes belong to very rare conditions,
combined with less than 1.2% occurrence in the original and
2.5% occurrence in the up-sampled dataset. Still, our stacked
logistic regression algorithm was able to balance this issue
and infer the correct ‘EDN’ and ‘CRS’ classifications through
context. Overall, our applied ensemble learning strategies
resulted in a significant performance improvement compared
to the individual deep convolutional neural network models.
More details on the internal performance evaluation are listed
in Tab. 2.

3 .2. External Evaluation through the RIADD Challenge
```
```
Furthermore, we participated at the RIADD challenge which
was organized by the authors of the RFMiD dataset [7], [8].
The challenge participation allowed not only an independent

evaluation of the predictive power of our pipeline on an
unseen and unpublished testing set, but also the comparison
with the currently best retinal disease classifiers in the world.
In our participation, we were able to reach rank 19
from a total of 59 teams in the first evaluation phase and rank
8 in the final phase. In the independent evaluation from the
challenge organizers, we achieved an AUROC of 0.95 for the
disease risk classification. For multi-label scoring, they
computed the average between the macro-averaged AUROC
and the mAP, for which we reached the score 0.70. The top
performing ranks shared only a marginal scoring difference
which is why we had only a final score difference of 0.0 5 to
the first ranked team. Furthermore, the participation results
demonstrated that ensemble learning based classification for
deep convolutional neural network models is compatible or
even superior to other approaches in the scientific field such
as focusing on a single large architecture.

**3. 3. Experiments and Improvements**

Additionally, we experimented with using weighted cross-
entropy loss for training our both model types. This resulted
in inferior models for disease label classification, however,
the cross-entropy loss fitted disease risk detector models
showed less overfitting with equal performance. Further
experimentation with loss functions for the disease risk
detector models could provide the solution to avoid
overfitting.
An important point for the RIADD challenge
participation would be the utilization of more training data,
especially for the difficult ‘CRS’ and ‘EDN’ classes.
According to the challenge rules, other public available
datasets like Kaggle DR, IDRiD, Messidor or APTOS are
allowed to be used as additional training data [8]. Our
pipeline, which was trained exclusively on the RFMiD
dataset, could be further improved with more retinal images
of very rare conditions. Besides the training data, more
improvement points for further research in retinal disease
detection would be the inclusion of image cropping strategies
to reduce information loss through resolution resizing, the
usage of more architectures (especially with different input
resolutions) to increase the model ensemble, and the
utilization of specific retinal filters or retinal vessel
segmentation as additional information to utilize for the
predictions.

**4. CONCLUSIONS**

In this study, we introduced a powerful multi-disease
detection pipeline for retinal imaging which exploits
ensemble learning techniques to combine the predictions of
various deep convolutional neural network models. Next to
state-of-the-art strategies, such as transfer learning, class
weighting, extensive real-time image augmentation and Focal
loss utilization, we applied 5-fold cross-validation as bagging
technique and used multiple convolutional neural network

```
architectures to create an ensemble of models. With a
stacking approach of class-wise distinct logistic regression
models, we combined the knowledge of all neural network
models to compute highly accurate and reliable retinal
condition predictions. Next to an internal performance
evaluation, we also proved the precision and comparability of
our pipeline through the participation at the RIADD
challenge.
