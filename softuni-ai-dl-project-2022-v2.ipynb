    "_I have tried to provide a nice flow, ease of read and a friendly and humorous tone of the article, and at the same time clear and understandable communication. In order to aid this I have provided a narrative to this article. In order to distinguish it I have used italics for it throughout the article. Please consider any text in italics, such as the one you are currently reading, as narrative. It can also be both in bold and italics._\n",

    "### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "_Currently most of the code in the article has been refactored into separate functions and most of the other code in the article is left fragmented throughout. There is a very good reason for this, which is that one of the aims of this article is to also understand a bit of Deep Learning. This is why the fragments of code throughout this article are used to help us and illustrate and demonstrate different parts of Deep Learning as a whole._\n",
